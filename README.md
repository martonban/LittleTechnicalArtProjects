# [WIP] Techcnical Art Projects
In this repository you can find different kind of techincal art projects. This is not the final form of these projects. This is just a prototype version of these shaders witch I am going to implement in my games, or in my own rendering engine.  

# Getting started
The projects are created mainly in Godot and Unity. In the catalog I'll annotate wich version do you need to run those projects.

# Projects
## 00 - ShaderCourse(GameDevTV) <Godot 4.2.1>
This project is a course by GameDev.TV [The course](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/godot-shaders) is teached me the fundamentals of shader devlopment in Godot 4. This course is cover 2D and 3D shaders.
The course coverd topics like vertex shaders, fragment shaders, tiling, grayscale, gradient colors, masking, texture scrolling, normal maps anfd much more <br><br><br>

## 01 - 3D Shaders Collection <Godot 4.2.1>
These are my own developed 3D shaders in godot. In this project there is only one scene, where every shader I devloped is there.

### Wet Stone Shader
I created a simple stone shader. The developers have a control over the moisture on the stone surface. I get a PBR materiial from Polyhaven. After I applied on a model created in belnder I modified different parameters of the material based on some noise texture. <br><br>

### Gaussian Edge Detection
This is a simple gaussian edge detection shader

### Simple Glass Shader

### Procedural Mosaic Shader (WIP)
This shader will able to make create mosaic shader procedurally based on the albedo(color) texture. If you are interested in a technical deep dive how I did it please check out [this wiki page](https://github.com/martonban/LittleTechnicalArtProjects/wiki/1-%E2%80%90-Procedural-Mosaic-Material)
